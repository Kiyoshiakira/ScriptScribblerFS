/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the ScriptScribbler application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 * Scripts, characters, and notes are stored as subcollections under each user's document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own scripts, characters, and notes.
 * - Listing other users' data is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * N/A (Path-based authorization is sufficient)
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * N/A (All user data is private and stored under the /users/{userId} path)
