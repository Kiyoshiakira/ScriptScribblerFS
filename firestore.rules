/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for ScriptSync
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and scripts, while also supporting collaborative access to scripts.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/scripts/{scriptId}: Stores scripts owned by a specific user, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /scripts/{scriptId}/scenes/{sceneId}: Stores scenes associated with a specific script.
 * - /scripts/{scriptId}/characters/{characterId}: Stores characters associated with a specific script.
 * - /scripts/{scriptId}/collaborations/{collaborationId}: Stores collaboration sessions for a script. Includes denormalized 'userId' and 'role' for authorization independence.
 * - /scenes/{sceneId}/sceneCharacters/{sceneCharacterId}: Stores the relationship between scenes and characters.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only read and write scripts they own.
 * - Listing of user profiles is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Collaborations allow for shared access to scripts based on user roles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Collaboration documents denormalize `userId` and `role` for efficient authorization. This avoids costly `get()` calls to a separate user roles collection.
